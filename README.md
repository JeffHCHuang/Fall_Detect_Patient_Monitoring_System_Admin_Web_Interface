# FallingMyo Patient Monitoring System Administrator Web Interface
This is a web application written using AngularJS, Bootstrap, and the Firebase API which serves as a central interface for hospital personnel monitoring patients through the FallingMyo Patient Monitoring System, a project I have created along with teammates, Aftab Narsimhan and Renee Slamka, at nwHacks 2015 hosted at the University of British Columbia.
