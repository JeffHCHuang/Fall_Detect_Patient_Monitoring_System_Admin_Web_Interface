# Fall Detect Patient Monitoring System Administrator Web Interface
This is a web application written using AngularJS, Bootstrap, and the Firebase API which serves as a central interface for hospital personnel monitoring patients through the FallingMyo Patient Monitoring System, a project I have created along with teammates, Aftab Narsimhan and Renee Slamka, at nwHacks 2015 hosted at the University of British Columbia. It receives alerts and updates of patients' statuses sent via the patient-facing Android application (https://github.com/JeffHCHuang/Fall_Detect_Patient_Monitoring_System_Android_App).
